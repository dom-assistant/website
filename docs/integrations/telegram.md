BotFather asks you for the name you want to give to your bot. This will be the name displayed in your chats.

Then, you will have to indicate a "public" name, which will make it possible to find it in the directory. We have to chose a unique name.

Please note that the name must end with "bot", to clearly identify that it is a robot.



In the message sent to you by BotFather, there is the API key under the line "Use this token to access the HTTP API:"
